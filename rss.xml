            <description><![CDATA[<h1>What Scientists Know About Climate Change and Hurricanes: QuickTake Q&amp;A</h1>,<p>These days, as soon as winds hit 74 miles per hour or barometric pressure drops below 990 millibars, people want to know: Is climate change behind this hurricane? It’s an even more pressing question when a giant storm like Harvey is followed by an even more gigantic one like Irma, which itself is being followed by Jose and Katia. Climate scientists continue to wrestle with the connection between global warming and individual storms, but they’re more confident than ever that there’s some linkage.</p>,<p>Read More here:</p>,<article><img src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izX5cgpq7C_A/v1/1200x818.jpg"><h1>What Scientists Know About Climate Change and Hurricanes: QuickTake Q&amp;A</h1><p>These days, as soon as winds hit 74 miles per hour or barometric pressure drops below 990 millibars, people want to know: Is climate change behind this hurricane?

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Tesla and SpaceX Share More Than Musk</h1>,<p>Engineers at Tesla Inc. found a quality problem earlier this summer with a cast aluminum auto part that was taking hours to diagnose and fix. They were stumped, so they called in the rocket scientists -- literally.</p>,<p>Tesla engineers reached out to their counterparts at Space Exploration Technologies Corp., who recommended the use of ultrasound sensors to isolate the problem. The solution saved Tesla about eight hours of work per car, an eternity on an assembly line aiming to ramp up to mass-market volumes.</p>,<p>Rocket ships and electric cars may seem like very different ends of the transportation spectrum, but for these two manufacturers, there’s one key link: They share a chief executive officer in Elon Musk. There are less obvious connections, too. The growing behind-the-scenes collaboration that occurs within Musk’s expanding, post-modern empire has spanned from finding stronger, lighter and cheaper materials to developing software to even sharing executives when the need for trusted talent arises.</p>,<p>“In this race to disrupt the world with both electric cars and autonomy as well as space, you don’t really work for Tesla or SpaceX. You just work for Elon Musk,” technology analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures said. “You have the most wicked-smart people who can feed off of each other all working for Elon, and he can call on them to help crack various problems.”</p>,<p>Read More here:</p>,<article><img src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7uZK5YGsgaU/v0/1200x800.jpg"><h1>Tesla and SpaceX Share More Than Musk</h1><p>Engineers at found a quality problem earlier this summer with a cast aluminum auto part that was taking hours to diagnose and fix.
