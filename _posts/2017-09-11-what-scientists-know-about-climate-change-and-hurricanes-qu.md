  These days, as soon as winds hit 74 miles per hour or barometric pressure
  drops below 990 millibars, people want to know: Is climate change behind this
  hurricane? It’s an even more pressing question when a giant storm like Harvey
  is followed by an even more gigantic one like Irma, which itself is being
  followed by Jose and Katia. Climate scientists continue to wrestle with the
  connection between global warming and individual storms, but they’re more
  confident than ever that there’s some linkage.
