# A Taxonomy for the Earth Observation Services Market

Enhancing the perception and performance of the EO service industry

---

The Earth Observation Service market is currently characterized by the segmentation and diversity. Mainly composed by SMEs and grand funded "customers", EO service market is undergoing significant changes...

To better understand the structure of the market the following categorization of "market players" by EARSC (European Association of Remote Sensing Companies) has been adopted:

1. Managed living resources rather than "agriculture, forest and fisheries", to indicate where mankind is exploiting natural organic resources ie farming in the very general sense. However, farming would be too open to misinterpretation and we need a description to distinguish from "energy and mineral resources" which concerns extractive industries.
2. Energy and natural resources which applies to the extractive industries. We do not use the latter term as we include alternative energy in this super-category.
3. Industrial which is applied to all manufacturing and physical supply including the utilities. Whilst electricity can be considered as energy and water could be taken as a natural resource, the activity of enterprises is largely an industrial one and allows us to more easily include waste. The market category "communications" is included under industry since the applications coming from EO services are mainly tied to the infrastructure side and not the services part of communications. The supply of content (using telecoms) is included under "news and media" in the services super-category.
4. Services is a broad area of activity that touches on many other market sectors. The categories we have included are quite readily identifiable as a service and not part of the physical supply of goods. Compared to CEOS we have taken out the market category of software since we find this too broad and confusing. Any games or other entertainment software where EO service may be used can be included under media. We include supply logistics under retail. Strictly, this will not cover all logistics activities e.g. supply chain management but in the absence of evidence that this is a significant market sector in its own right (for EO services) we believe it does not merit a separate category. This may be open to review in the future.
5. Public authorities is a term that is widely recognized and we feel is sufficiently important to the EO services industry that it should be retained. However, we choose to recognize that many of the functions may be outsourced and hence commercial activities associated with (say) town planning and architecture are included in this market category. Security is a new(ish) topic that is missing and will added to give "defense and security".
6. International bodies is a super-category that covers activities that are associated largely with international treaties and hence there is strong international collaboration. We distinguish from regional co-operation as might be the case in the European Union where in fact most actions are national in nature -- hence come under public authorities. This means that environment and climate come under this super-category as well as humanitarian and development actions. We recognize that many of the activities covered under this category are also of interest to private organizations. We believe that these should be included elsewhere through the detailed level of the services offered. Hence in our terminology, international bodies is a market area where sales are to the international bodies directly e.g. UN or the network of supporting organizations e.g. NGO's or climate consultancy.
